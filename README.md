Beginner Repository 

Hello to all that may be reading this!

My name is Thashon Srikantharajah, and this is my first repository I have made on GitHub.
A new beginning to many I hope. Some languages I am very comfortable with at the moment are: HTML,CSS,JavaScript,mySQL,Bootstraps, as well as Java Coding as my main preference for coding Language. 
I hope to gain many more skills and further improve my knowledge in these languages, by contributing to other projects online as well as creating and learning about my own projects. 

Hello New World and I hope to grow exponentially using this environment as my nurturing tool!
